With this small program at hand, a training file containing letter frequencies can be generated for texts written in the different languages. The ANN will, of course, be better at distinguishing the languages if frequencies for many different texts are available in the training file, but for this small example, 3-4 texts in each language should be enough. Listing 2 shows a pre-generated training file using four text files for each of the three languages, and Figure 2 shows a graphical representation of the frequencies in the file. A thorough inspection of this file shows clear trends: English has more H's than the other two languages, French has almost no K's, and Polish has more W's and Z's than the other languages. The training file only uses letters in the A to Z range, but since a language like Polish uses letters like Ł, Ą, and Ę which are not used in the other two languages, a more precise ANN could be made by adding input neurons for these letters as well. When only comparing three languages, there is, however, no need for these added letters since the remaining letters contain enough information to classify the languages correctly, but if the ANN were to classify hundreds of different languages, more letters would be required.
